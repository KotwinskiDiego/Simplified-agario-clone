# Agar.io (Simplified Clone)

This is a **simplified copy of the classic Agar.io game**, made using **Python** and **Pygame**.  
Simplified because it doesn’t include advanced mechanics such as:

- Multiplayer or online gameplay  
- Map scaling or camera zoom  
- Virus mechanics (spiky cells that split you)  
- Player skins or color customization  
- Physics-based smooth mass splitting  
- Leaderboards or score tracking system  

AI is very simple — if the enemy is smaller, it runs away from you; if it’s bigger, it chases you.

You control a circular player that grows by eating smaller food dots.  
Avoid larger enemies, move towards smaller ones, and try to survive as long as possible!
